## Prerequisite Knowledge
This book was designed for readers who have fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as experience working with the Document-Object Model (DOM), however if the reader is not entirely familiar with the above skills, I recommend first reading: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [W3C School](http://www.w3schools.com/), [JavaScript Core](http://weizhifeng.net/javascript-the-core.html) or my [previous courses](http://kdchang.cc/web-programming-course/) for learning. Furthermore, this book uses ES6+ for all of its demos, if you need a comparison sheet to ES5 usage, please refer to Appendix 1 [React ES5, ES6+ Common Usage Reference Sheet](https://github.com/sycherng/reactjs101/tree/en-US/Appendix01).
