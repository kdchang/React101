## Foreword
Due to rising complexity within professional modern web development and increasing demand for User Experience(UX), web development has transitioned from the "Web Developer" roles of the past where one developer handled the entire product, to role specialization, adding detailed division of work with roles in Web Front-End and Web Back-End. Additionally as demand for cross-platform and cross-browser support grows and the technologies and skills used rapidly evolve, the market's demand for Web Front-End Engineers also increases by the day, and challenges of Front-End Engineering will be ever increasing.

## Front-End Development Scope
In truth, currently within the industry, the scope of Front-End Development falls under a wide spectrum, some focus on Web Design alone, and some include aspects of Software Engineering, this book will focus on the latter. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the most important fundamental skills in Front-End Engineering. Sometime in the past, we knew Front-End Engineering to be focused on browser platforms, but today's Web platform is no longer only about desktop browsers, instead it now encompasses cross-platform, cross-browser application development environments, including:

1. Web Browser, webapp development
2. Using command-line interfaces (CLI) to operate Headless Applications, for example: [phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/), etc
3. WebView Applications. For example: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) to permit mobile and desktop application development.
4. Native Applications written with web development technologies, for example: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Native Script](https://www.nativescript.org/), etc.

In the past few years, Front-End development seems to have experienced a Rinascimento (French for renaissance), marking the beginnings of an era with a plethora of various frameworks and modules. Althrough there are now numerous great tools to assist in the development process, the work of a Front-End developer has not become easier. In the past, sensible use of jQuery library methods was sufficient to cover the bulk of a Front-End developer's job, but nowadays recruitment adverts not only ask for mastery in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, they also ask for a specific level of comprehension of JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) etc.

Amongst the numerous Javascript frameworks and libraries, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is an open-source [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) Library developed by Facebook. Its appearance enabled many revolutionary web concepts to become mainstream, for example: Virtual DOM, Web Component, more intuitive declarative UI design, more elegantly realized Server Rendering, etc. The rest of this book will use an introduction to the React ecosystem to introduce readers to the React world, allowing readers to write cross-platform React applications from scratch.
